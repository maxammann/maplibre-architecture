Each of the GL libraries uses different terminology in its public APIs. This is because each library attempts to feel natural to developers on that platform.

## Conflicts in usage

The following terms in the Mapbox Style Specification have different meanings on the native platforms. The table below examines these terms along with a limited selection of terms from the GL librariesâ€™ public APIs. Definitions in _italics_ denote concepts that the Mapbox GL developers have no control over.

| Term | Web | iOS/macOS | Android |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| annotation | Directions API metadata | a point or shape overlay | _Java language feature_; Directions API metadata |
| attribute | part of an HTML element | vector tile metadata; Directions API metadata | â€” |

| class | a way to toggle paint properties | _language feature_ | _language feature_ |
| filter | a way to hide features in a layer | _Apple compositing feature_ | a way to hide features in a layer |
| function | _JavaScript language feature_; a variable property value | _2 different Objective-C/Swift language features_ | _Java language feature_; a variable property value
| id | unique identifier | _Objective-C language keyword_ | unique identifier |
| layer | similar to an overlay, but part of the map | _Apple animation feature_ | similar to an overlay, but part of the map |
| map view | an occasion a map is viewed | a container for a map | a container for a map |
| region | â€” | akin to bounding box | bundle of resources for offline usage |
| plugin | _browser feature_; GL helper library | GL helper library; _obscure application extension feature_ (macOS) | GL helper library
| point | 1D shape | unit of distance; 1D shape | 1D shape |
| property | _JavaScript language feature_; an option for a style layer or vector feature | _Objective-C/Swift language feature_ | _Java language feature_; an option for a style layer or vector feature |

## Platform-specific naming conventions

These differences in terminology have led to a number of differences in the librariesâ€™ public APIs, as illustrated in the following table. ðŸ›£ denotes a term used in a client of the Mapbox Directions API that is used together with a GL library (Mapbox GL Directions, MapboxDirections.swift, Mapbox Java SDK).
