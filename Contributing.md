# Use `clang-format`

The project includes a `.clang-format` file describing some of the code style we use. When contributing new code, please make sure that it (mostly) passes through this filter unchanged. Note that there are sometimes cases where the output is not desirable.

From the command line, run `clang-format -style=file <filename>`

There are some editor integrations as well:
- [Sublime Text 3](https://github.com/rosshemsley/SublimeClangFormat)
- [Xcode](https://github.com/travisjeffery/ClangFormat-Xcode)
